# Maui.MicroFrontend

This repository contains the Sample Code of my talk about MicroFrontend in Xamarin/Maui
Here you can find the presentation:

## Proposal
The purpose of this presentation is to share my experience in Microfrontend technology, as well as a reflection on how to migrate a monolithic application to Microfrontend

## TimeLine
I separated the migration moments into different branches, based on the transition slide between Monolith and MFE

- [Monolith](https://github.com/felipebaltazar/Maui.MicroFrontend/tree/master)

- [Folder Structure/Common](https://github.com/felipebaltazar/Maui.MicroFrontend/tree/migration/pt-1)

- [Segregation/MicroApps](https://github.com/felipebaltazar/Maui.MicroFrontend/tree/migration/pt-2)
